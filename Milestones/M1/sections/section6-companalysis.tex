Our web app has numerous planned advantages compared to our competitors. One of the advantages is that our app can guarantee the credibility of the seller. We make sure that all users of our app are SFSU students, staff, or faculty. We make sure that buyers can easily contact the seller. Another advantage is that our seller and buyer will be able to meet in person, in a safe and public environment, whether it be on campus or otherwise. We also have a site administrator that guarantees the validity of each item posted and swiftly approves each post or rejects inappropriate posts.
