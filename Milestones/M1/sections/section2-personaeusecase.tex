\item[Use Case 1: Administrative Functions (Kobe)]\hfill\\
Kobe is an admin user of the app. He opens his laptop and browses to the web page of the app while he is sitting in front of a desk at his home. After logging into his account, he needs to troubleshoot the app to ensure all features and functionalities of the app are working correctly. After that, he wants to review and validate the new posts of products to ensure that they are appropriate and follow company guidelines. Valid posts will be approved by Kobe and can be viewed by all users. Kobe will deny invalid posts and give an explanation for why the post is invalid. Finally, Kobe reviews the feedback from app users and decides any future actions need to handle.

\item[Use Case 2: Purchase SFSU Apparel (Claire)]\hfill\\
Claire is laying on her bed while she thinks about her next swimming event. She thinks that her SFSU suit is worn out and definitely needs an upgrade. She takes her smartphone and opens the web browser. She googles PurpleMarket and opens the website. She goes on categories and clicks “SFSU Apparel”. She browses through the different options on her phone and reads their reviews. While browsing, she decides to also look for more SFSU merchandise and browses through SFSU mugs, keychains and SFSU notebooks for her desk. While she is at it, she also goes through some of the notes which are offered by past students for her classes. Finally, she’s happy and when she attempts to message the sellers in the web application to set up a time and place to meet to purchase the items, the web application prompts her to login or register.  Because Claire in on campus most of the time, it is easy for her to meet up on campus to complete the transaction.  When she shows up to the agreed location to complete the transaction, one of the sellers does not show up.  She is not too upset because she was able to complete a couple of other things, so she leaves a message to the seller on the website to see if they can schedule another meeting.  The second time around, the seller shows up and the transaction is completed.  She leaves a mediocre review of the seller because the seller did not let her know of the cancellation ahead of time.

\item[Use Case 3: Request Items (Anna)]\hfill\\
Anna is sitting on her front desk one day before the beginning of the first day of instruction. She wants to share handwritten notes of her past student and is hoping to contact him for the same. She opens the www website and looks for the notes under the class. Thankfully she finds the student having a post about the same.  When she attempts to contact him about it, the website prompts her to login or register. Once logged in and/or registered she is able to message her past student and set up a meeting on campus to complete the transaction.

\item[Use Case 4: Purchase through browsing (Curry)]\hfill\\
Curry is an SFSU full-time university staff. He wants to shop for some items on the secondary market held by the SFSU community, so he opens the web application and browses posts of items in his office during his break. First, he just randomly browsed items by categories including books, electronic products, and household supplies. After a couple of minutes, he realizes that there is a book that he was interested to buy recently. He enters the name of that book to search listed posts, and then there are a couple of listed posts that show up. He clicks on one post in order to find more information about the item and sell information. He messages the seller telling him that he wants to buy the book. Finally, using the website, Curry sets up a meeting time and place on campus to complete the transaction.  His experience is great, so he leaves a positive review of the seller.

\item[Use Case 5: Selling furniture (Anna)]\hfill\\
Anna feels like her house is too cluttered with some old furniture she no longer uses.  One item she wants to sell is a small bookshelf.  She has looked at eBay and the process to sell items seems too complicated and she does not want to deal with having to ship something or coordinating a meetup with someone who might be coming from farther away.  In addition, Anna has heard that Craigslist has a lot of scammers, so she is uncomfortable with providing any sort of contact information there.  Because PurpleMarket only allows people associated with SFSU, she feels safer to meet with a potential buyer.  Also, the website gives her a simple way to be contacted without providing her personal contact information and coordinate a meeting to complete the transaction.  Once she goes onto the website, she is able to easily find the button to sell her items.  Through some simple prompts, she is able to enter in a title, description, price, and photos of her items.  Once she composes her sales listing, the website prompts her to login or register.  Once she requests the listing, the website informs her of the required administrative approval process.  An admin quickly approves the post and she is notified that her listing was approved and published.  Three days later, she gets a message directly on the website inquiring about her bookshelf.  Through the website, she is able to respond and suggest a meeting spot on-campus.  After agreeing on a price and location, she is able to put the meeting on her schedule.  When she shows up to the agreed upon location, the buyer never shows up.  Because of this, she leaves a bad review for the buyer.

\item[Use Case 6: Selling textbook (Claire)]\hfill\\
Before the new semester starts, Claire thinks it is a good time to sell a history textbook she used last semester.  Since she knows that her book is required for the class, she is certain that students will need that exact textbook for the history class in the coming semester.  Because of this, she understands that she will be able to sell it quickly to students at SFSU without the hassle of shipping or coordinating a meeting someone that is not associated with the school.  Since she is at the library, she decides that using her phone would be the easiest way to post her listing.  With a prominent post button on the main page, it is easy for her to start her listing.  Once on the composition page, she is able to quickly run through the prompts to list her book.  One feature she is grateful for is the ability to associate the book with the specific class that requires it.  Once she snaps a quick photo on her phone, she completes the listing and the website then prompts her to login or register.  Once logged in, the website informs her of the required administrative approval process.  Once approved, Claire is notified that her listing was approved and published.  To her pleasant surprise, she is immediately contacted on the website by another student inquiring about her book.  Through the website, she is able to respond and suggest a meeting spot on-campus.  After agreeing on the price and location, she is able to complete the transaction on-campus.  Because she was happy with the transaction, she leaves a glowing review of the purchaser.
