\section{Project Management}
The team is divided into two main categories: front-end and back-end.  Each category has been assigned a lead, with two developers assigned to each lead.  The team lead is responsible for tracking and maintaining project progress and establishing high-level goals while contributing to either the front-end or back-end as needed.  With the input of the team, the team lead will set deadlines for deliverables and work with the front-end and back-end leads to create a plan of action to complete objectives. The front-end and back-end leads are responsible for assigning tasks for their particular portion of the project while managing their particular deliverables.  All tasks are tracked via shared Trello boards and progress (or problems) will be communicated via Discord.  In the case that either the front-end or back-end teams encounter setbacks, the team lead will coordinate with all members to redistribute the workload.  Our number one priority is maintaining an active line of communication between all stakeholders to ensure that the back-end provides the tools necessary for the front-end to deliver a great user experience.
