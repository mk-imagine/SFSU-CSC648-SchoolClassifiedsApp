\section{User Interface Storyboards}

\subsection{Administrative Functions Use Case: Kobe}
As an administrator, Kobe will need to approve or deny posts as needed and provide explanations for approval or denial (Figure \ref{fig:postmgmt}).  Before approval, Kobe will inspect each post to ensure that the posting follows the website's terms and conditions (Figure \ref{fig:postdetails}).  In addition, he will be able to contact and ban users, delete and edit user posts, and inspect user transaction history.  Priority 1 implementation shall be through MySQL workbench and/or MySQL command line interface.  The following user interface storyboards illustrate a priority 3 implementation for administration through the website.

\subsection{Purchase SFSU Apparel Use Case: Claire}
Claire is purchasing SFSU apparel from other users.  Using her laptop, she goes onto PurpleMarket and selects ``SFSU Apparel'' from the categories and browses the available listings (Figure \ref{fig:sfsu}).  Once she finds the swimsuit, she views the item details (Figure \ref{fig:itemc}), then attempts to message the seller for a swimsuit.  The website then informs her that to message a seller, she must first register for a free account or login (Figure \ref{fig:loginc}).  Since she is not signed up, she must register (Figure \ref{fig:regc}).  Once signed up, she is presented with a message page that allows her to message the seller (Figure \ref{fig:msgc}) and the website tells her that her message was successfully sent (Figure \ref{fig:msgconfc}).  Once the transaction is completed, the website prompts her to leave a review.
